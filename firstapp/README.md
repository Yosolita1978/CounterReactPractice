Create a counter component
    * Count (number)
    * Button to add
      * Function to add 1 to count when is clicked
    * button to -
    *   Function to sub 1 to count when is clicked
        if count goes < 0 console.log (Let's keep positive)
    * Resset button
        Function to always put count as 0 

Import that component to my app.
